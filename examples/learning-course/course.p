wanna-learn:
	- [ ]  Learn probability and stats and betting maths
	- [ ]  what is a distribution? what is a random variable?
		- [ ]  To reason statistically, you need a stable distribution. Black Swans live in **unknown or shifting distributions**. You don’t know:
			
			– the tail thickness,
			
			– the true variance,
			
			– whether the distribution tomorrow matches today.
			
		
		So statements like “this happens once every 100 years” are category errors. You are inferring frequency from a sample that *cannot contain the event you’re worried about*.
		
	- [ ]  what is a joint distribution? what does that mean?
	- [ ]  what is a hilbert space?
	- [ ]  what are the different camps of probability - induction vs. bayesian - can you explain/teach them?
	- [ ]  how does a p-test work? why?
	- [ ]  how does measuring more times increase accuracy?
	- [ ]  what is a fat tailed distribution? like what’s the equation
	- [ ]  what’s **sampling, what’s bayesian statistics, what’s a monte carlo method?**
		- [ ]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method
	- [ ]  what’s a fourier transform?
