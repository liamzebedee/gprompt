the general tree/content panes don't do what I want them to do

desired behaviour:
    the cluster starts up
    we call apply, it starts agents which each are loops
    from that moment forward - the steering ui should show iteration 1 of every agent's loop in the tree as it is working at that moment
    on the right, each pane should show the live convo thread of claude running in that iteration loop. ALL messags, incl tool uses, etc.

current behaviour:
    start up cluster, call apply
    go to steer UI
    there are no iterations shown
    only when an iteration is completeted is it added to the UI
    and only then we can only see the final message, not the full convo chain for that iteration
