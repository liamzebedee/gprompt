# Reckoning with Reality: The Friction Between Promise and Practice

The boardroom narrative around artificial intelligence has long traded on inevitability -- the idea that adoption is simply a matter of when, not whether. But the lived experience of enterprises deploying AI at scale tells a far messier story. Regulation has arrived unevenly, creating a patchwork of compliance regimes that punish smaller players while leaving the largest incumbents to self-police. Environmental costs, once dismissed as a footnote, have become impossible to ignore: the water and energy demands of training runs now rival those of small cities, and the carbon ledger grows with every new foundation model. Meanwhile, the catalog of outright failures -- biased hiring tools, hallucinating medical advisors, autonomous vehicles that cannot parse a construction zone -- has quietly ballooned. These are not edge cases. They are the predictable consequences of deploying probabilistic systems into deterministic expectations, and they have begun to erode the public trust that the entire industry depends on.

What makes this reckoning particularly uncomfortable is that many of the failures were foreseeable and, in some cases, foreseen. Researchers published warnings about dataset bias, energy consumption, and brittle generalization years before the products shipped. The warnings were noted, cited in appendices, and then systematically subordinated to deployment timelines and quarterly targets. Enterprise adoption, rather than serving as a forcing function for rigor, often amplified the problem: organizations purchased AI capabilities they lacked the infrastructure to evaluate, measured success by deployment velocity rather than outcome quality, and treated vendor benchmarks as gospel. The result is a landscape in which the gap between what AI can demonstrably do and what it is marketed as doing has become one of the industry's most consequential liabilities -- not just financially, but in terms of the regulatory backlash and public skepticism it continues to generate.

**Conclusion:** Honest progress requires honest accounting. Until the industry treats its failures with the same enthusiasm it reserves for its breakthroughs -- cataloging them publicly, pricing in their externalities, and building governance structures that have teeth rather than talking points -- the distance between artificial intelligence as it is and artificial intelligence as it is sold will remain the field's defining vulnerability.
